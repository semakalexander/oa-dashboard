-   How long did you spend on the evaluation?

Approximately 20 hours

-   Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

There is no big chance to show any specific skills, but considering that design was blocked for main part of application I've attached design screenshot into app and use it as overlay to adjust all sizes to get better result.

-   Which parts did you spend the most time on? What was the most difficult aspect?

I have installed amcharts V5 which add a lot of complexity into developing, because there is no such detailed documentation as V4 and most of Q&A that I found in web were for V4. It took like half of all developing time and eventually I replace it by V4.

-   How did you like the evaluation overall? Did you run into any issues or have trouble completing?

Generally I like it.

-   Do you have any suggestions or improvements for how we could improve the evaluation in your mind?

I would suggest to clarify that design was blocked moderatly, because some devs could not be sure if it's task specific or it's simple mistake.
Also, I would suggest to bring more clarification about charts data -> I see that there are 3 data structures displayed by design - revenue, gross margin and cost of goods. But API provides only first 2 of them. I put fake data for the cost of goods, but I guess it would be better if this was written in task description.
